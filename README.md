# Pacman_1
 pacman search algortihm


In this project, we are trying to help Pacman find paths through a maze to reach a certain position or to efficiently collect valuable objects (food). The general requirement is to implement general search algorithms and apply them to the Pacman game. In this project, the files search.py and searchAgent.py were modified.

Question 1: Finding a fixed Food element in the maze using Depth First Search. The depthFirstSearch function in search.py has been implemented.

Question 2: Finding a fixed Food element in the maze using Breadth First Search. The breadthFirstSearch function in search.py has been implemented.

Question 3: Finding a fixed Food element in the maze using Uniform Cost Search. The uniformCostSearch function will search.py has been implemented.

Question 4: Finding a fixed Food element in the maze using the A* algorithm.
